# Report

## Dataset

The dataset consists of weather data provided by the Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics ([ZAMG](http://www.zamg.ac.at/)) for the weather station *Linz/Hörsching* in Austria for the year 2016.

Since ZAMG does not provide the data directly, the website <http://at-wetter.tk> was used to get the values. This website stores the ZAMG values for all weather stations since 2014 and provides them via a public REST API.

We have *hourly* values for the whole year 2016, which sums up to 8784 total entries. The following attributes are provided:

  1. Temperature [°C]
  1. Dew Point [°C]
  1. Relative Humidity [%] (range: 0-100)
  1. Wind Direction [°] (range: 0-359)
  1. Wind Speed [km/h]
  1. Peak Wind Speed [km/h]
  1. Precipitation [l/m²]
  1. Atmospheric Pressure (sea level) [hPa]
  1. Atmospheric Pressure (station level) [hPa]
  1. Sunshine [%] (range: 0-100)
